1. Student Grade Generator

It prompts the user for multiple student names and their corresponding marks. It validates the input and assigns grades based on the criteria that was issued.
Users can end the input by typing "done" instead of a student name. Finally, the program displays a table with their names, marks, and assigned grades.

2. Speed Detector

It takes a car's speed as input. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it displays "Ok". Otherwise, it calculates demerit points based on the following rules:

For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), the driver receives one demerit point.
If the total demerit points exceed 12, the program displays "License suspended".
Otherwise, it prints the total number of demerit points.
3. Net Salary Calculator

It calculates an individual's net salary. It prompts the user for their basic salary and benefits. It calculates the PAYE, NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, Gross Salary and Net Salary.
